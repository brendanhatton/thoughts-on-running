# About
## What is this?
I am a runner. I have been for as long as I can remember. I recall coming second in my year 4 cross country race and being displeased. Over the years, I have spent more time than most people either running, recovery from running, thinking about running, or being injured and wishing I could run. This is a collection of my thoughts, learnings and opinions formed over the years. I make no promises or guarantees, but I like to think 30 years of running has taught me a bit, and maybe I can share these learnings with others.

## Who am I?
As mentioned above, I am a lifelong runner and genuinely love the sport. Having said that, I am definitely in the 'enthusiastic amatuer' category, having never taken it too seriously or gotten too far. For numbers, my 10k pb is under 35 mins, half marathon ~77mins, and my training partner ran a ~2:45 marathon .... I watched from the sidelines with a stress fracture - but like to think I could have achieved a similar result. So, far from the hardcore / elite runners, but above average.

## Who is this aimed at?
This is not targeting elite athletes. They likely have coaches and people that know a lot more about what happens at the pointy end of the performance scale. This is primarily for beginners, amatuers, and enthusiastic amatuers.
